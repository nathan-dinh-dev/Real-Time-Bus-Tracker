# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
MIT xPro Coding Project - Real Time Bus Tracker

On the open-source mapbox platform, maps can be made and displayed online. The Mapbox ecosystem includes the mapboxgl JavaScript library. It enables you to customize the map in a variety of ways. You may, for instance, place a marker on the map where you want it to be.

In this project, I will use mapbox, an API to source real-time data of the Boston MBTA busses. During this project, I've learned how to display the live location of the busses on a map. I have also gained experience in how to gather real-time bus data from the MBTA API and try adding it to a Google Map.
