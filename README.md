# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

MIT xPro Coding Project - Real Time Bus Tracker

In this project, I used an API to source real-time data of the Boston MBTA busses. During this project, I've learned how to display the live location of the busses on a map. I have also gained experience in how to gather real-time bus data from the MBTA API and try adding it to a Google Map.

For future development experience, I will try to track my phone movement location.
